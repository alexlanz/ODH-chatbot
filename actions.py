# INFORMATION ABOUT RASA ACTIONS:
# Classes define the custom actions that we want to use inside of RASA Core. Below are two custom actions 
# that we'll be using when the user asks for help and one for finding restaurants. These actions are made up of two methods:
# one called name which sets the name of the action(it should be euqual to the name defined in the domain.yml file) 
# and another called run which is the actual action. The parameters are specific to RASA. 
# Dispatcher sends back user messages, the tracker keeps track of the conversation using slots and the domain is well... the domain
# For more info: https://www.rasa.com/docs/core/customactions/
